## Overview

Vampires are undead or supernatural beings that survive by consuming the blood or life force of the living. While blood-drinking entities appear in folklore worldwide, the modern vampire concept emerged primarily from Eastern European (especially Slavic and Romanian) traditions during the 18th century, when vampire hysteria led to official investigations and corpse exhumations. The 19th century literary vampire (Polidori, Le Fanu, Stoker) transformed folklore into the aristocratic seducer archetype. Vampire belief was historically connected to misunderstanding of decomposition, premature burial, and disease outbreaks.

## Etymology

- **Origin**: Uncertain; possibly from Serbian 'vampir' or earlier Slavic roots

## Scientific Explanations

| Theory | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Decomposition misunderstanding | Bloating, blood at mouth are natural |
| Premature burial | People buried alive escaped graves |
| Tuberculosis | "Consumption" caused wasting, blood, family spread |
| Rabies | Light sensitivity, aggression, biting |
| Porphyria | Blood disorder (largely discredited theory) |

### Paul Barber's Research
Forensic anthropologist Paul Barber demonstrated in *Vampires, Burial, and Death* (1988) that vampire descriptions match normal decomposition:
- Bloating from gases
- Blood at mouth from lung fluid
- "Growing" nails/hair (skin recession)
- Groaning when staked (gas release)
- Fresh appearance (cold burial conditions)
