      "summary": "Legendary creatures that subsist by feeding on blood of the living. Found in folklore worldwide with significant variation. The modern vampire concept crystallized from Eastern European traditions in the 18th century.",
      "full": "Vampires are undead or supernatural beings that survive by consuming the blood or life force of the living. While blood-drinking entities appear in folklore worldwide, the modern vampire concept emerged primarily from Eastern European (especially Slavic and Romanian) traditions during the 18th century, when vampire hysteria led to official investigations and corpse exhumations. The 19th century literary vampire (Polidori, Le Fanu, Stoker) transformed folklore into the aristocratic seducer archetype. Vampire belief was historically connected to misunderstanding of decomposition, premature burial, and disease outbreaks. Though no verified vampires have been documented, the legend remains powerful in global culture."
